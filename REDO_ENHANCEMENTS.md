# Redo Functionality Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the redo OCR functionality with two key improvements addressing user experience and mobile usability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Gesture Shortcut - Double-Tap
**Problem**: Three-finger gesture was impractical for mobile devices
**Solution**: Replaced with double-tap gesture

- **Gesture**: Double-tap on any image
- **Mobile-friendly**: Natural single-hand operation
- **Non-conflicting**: Doesn't interfere with existing gestures:
  - Single tap → Show details dialog
  - Long press → Select/deselect image
  - PhotoView gestures → Pinch to zoom, drag to pan
- **Feedback**: Light haptic feedback when triggered
- **Updated tooltip**: "Double-tap on image for quick redo"

### 2. Interactive Crop Screen
**Problem**: Crop screen wasn't interactive and couldn't resize crop area
**Solution**: Complete redesign with PhotoView integration and resizable crop

#### Features:
- **Full zoom capability**: Pinch to zoom in/out up to 3x
- **Pan support**: Drag to move image around
- **Resizable crop area**: Drag corners to resize selection
- **Movable crop area**: Drag center to reposition
- **Visual enhancements**:
  - Rule of thirds grid lines for better composition
  - Corner handles with visual feedback
  - Active handle highlighting (blue when resizing)
  - Semi-transparent overlay
  - Improved button design

#### User Experience:
- **Better instructions**: Clear hints with emoji icons
- **Dismissible hints**: "Got it!" button to hide instructions
- **Improved controls**: Icon buttons with better styling
- **Error handling**: Better error messages and state management
- **Memory management**: Proper image disposal to prevent leaks

## Technical Implementation

### Gesture Detection
```dart
onDoubleTap: () {
  _redoTextExtraction();
  HapticFeedback.lightImpact();
},
```

### Interactive Crop
- **PhotoView integration**: Full zoom and pan capabilities
- **Custom painter**: Enhanced crop overlay with grid and handles
- **Gesture handling**: Pan detection for move/resize operations
- **Coordinate transformation**: Accurate crop area mapping from screen to image coordinates
- **Image processing**: Direct image manipulation without RepaintBoundary

## Files Modified
- `lib/screens/gallery/image_gallery_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/gallery/redo_crop_screen.dart`

## Benefits
1. **Mobile-optimized**: Double-tap is natural on touchscreens
2. **Precise cropping**: Zoom in for accurate text selection
3. **Flexible selection**: Resizable crop area for any text size
4. **Better UX**: Clear visual feedback and instructions
5. **Improved accuracy**: Higher precision in OCR text selection
